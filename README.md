## About
### Method: Prepare the Data



Finally, I exported the cleaned and consolidated CSV file.

**Resource File I Used:**
  - crypto_market_data.csv

**My Jupyter Notebook Python Cleaning Script:**
  - Crypto_Clustering.ipynb

**Tools/Libraries I Imported:**
- pandas library: for data manipulation and analysis
- hvplot.pandas library: to create plots
- sklearn.cluster: to create clusters using k-means
- sklearn.decomposition: for principal component analysis (PCA)
- sklearn.preprocessing: used for normalising the data


## Getting Started

**Programs/software I used:**
 - Jupyter Notebook: python programming tool, was used for data manipulation and consolidation.

**To activate dev environment and open Jupyter Notebook:**
- Open Anaconda Prompt
- Activate dev environment, type 'conda activate dev'
- Navigate to the folder where repository is saved on local drive
- Open Jupyter Notebook, type 'Jupyter Notebook'
